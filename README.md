- 👋 Hi, I’m @patchell , I have been doing technical things since I was about 10 years old (1963).
From that first buzzer that I made then until now, each project has always been a challenge.  
I enjoy the challenge.

- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of things.  I have done embedded processors programmed in everything
from assembly, to PLM, to C++.  I have also done a lot of analog hardware design.  The thing I am most
proud of is the "Linear Voltage to exponential current converter"| that fully compensates for the
thermal drift due to 1/kT Term in the relationship between Vbe and Ic.
I also like coding.  At the moment, I am (or trying to) write a Recursive Decent Parser Generator, a program
for composing music that is played with a Novation Launch Pad.  Another project is
translating a Basic program (not written by myself) into C++, and then hopefully into Python.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning or trying to learn Python and more about the windows API.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, well, nothing.

- 📫 How to reach me : Well, that is a bit of a sticky
problem.  I do have an Email and Gmail addresses, BUT
I am notorious in not ready either of these for extremely
long periods of time.  patchell@cox.net
I also have a face book account.  If you search face book
using "James Patchell", I will be one of several hits.  My
profile says "Blind Dude at Currently Disabled".
